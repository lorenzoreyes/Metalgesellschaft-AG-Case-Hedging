This projects handles the Metalgesellschaft AG Case
You have to hedge oil contracts prices for what you
are already compromised, selling contracts at C $24 
160millions barrells (delta_barrels) of total 1.6 Billions

The goal is to test the Full-Stacked Hedge Strategy
which consists of covering your positions according 
it expires by each delivery that you make.
For that you have to, 
(1) generate binomial spot tree, 
so you have the evolution of your spot in time, Sts.
(2) then apply, (C - Sts) * delta_barrels of the period.
You will get the results of your deliveries evolution, or
call it your operative results.
(3) you need to know how your remaining contracts are
performing. So, grab again the binomial tree of your Sts, 
apply it by the total of your barrels compromised and add
the results of your deliveries.
(Sts * b) + operative_results
You will end up with the financial results, but also as you
have the evolution of each node, you also have the evolution
of your own budget.

Note: you start selling at C 24.0 with a S Spot of 20.0,
the difference multiply by delta barresls give you a
640.0 of Margin Safety to operate.
If you loose your Margin of Safety, you will get a 
critical node and end the game.
